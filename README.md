# Databases

## Relational Database Systems

### About

This three-week program aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of databases using MySQL.

### Key Objectives

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Entities
- The relational model
- The Structured Query Language (SQL)
- The construction of a database system
- MySQL as an example of a relational database system

## Lesson Plan

### Lesson 1: MySQL and Node Setup! Create, Insert and Select !

Objective: This class aims to incorporate JavaScript code to operate the MySQL database.
MySQL client can be used to demonstrate SQL queries however, students should know how to
make a MySQL database connection from JavaScript, run queries from JavaScript and
capture results of queries in JavaScript.

### Lesson 2: Group by, Having and Joins. Promisification of JS client with prepared statements

Objective: This class introduces more clauses (group by, having) in the
select statement. MySQL joins (inner, self, left and right) should be explained
with demonstration (Employee table with **reportsTo** field and Department
table with its PK in Employee table is suitable for this demonstration).
Promise based JavaScript program with SQL prepared statements should be
understood by students. The program can be found in the Week2 folder (Credits:

### Lesson 3: Database design, normal forms, SQL injection

Objective: This class invites students to discuss Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
Students should be able to explain their choices of entities, relationships, attributes etc.
SQL injection should be explained with a demonstration (with a simple JS client).
Concepts of database transaction, ACID properties, normal forms should be introduced with
examples / live coding (creating a transaction, committing and rollback-ing).

#### NoSQL
Students should know what are the differences between SQL and NoSQL.
We will use MongoDB as an example.

## Handing in homework
Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in.

Also review the Git [workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md) from the JavaScript3 module, use this as a reference.
