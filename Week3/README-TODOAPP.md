Yep, that is my code! You are probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. Lets go back a few days...

play(cheerful and upbeat music)

It all began when I initially planned to do this assignment with a session manager and wanted to put this in a cluster to keep it as a pet
project...

---ERR: CANT'T SET HEADERS AFTER THEY ARE SENT---

...where was I? oh yes. This kinda got snowballed out of control and I dont even recognize some parts of it. I also wanted to isolate the
connection object since I didnt want the DB credentials to be sent to the client BUT couldnt get it to work

---ERR: CANT'T SET HEADERS AFTER THEY ARE SENT---

Perfect timing generic express error! I spent hours on express documentation and tried to shuffle around with different modules, started over from scratch a couple of times and at here I am late at saturday night without any clue on how to handle this monstrosity. I spent 90% of my time wrestling with JS errors rather than learning anything additional about SQL queries. I also deleted the whole thing a couple of times but thanks to git IT IS NEVER TRULY GONE and I dont know if I should appreciate the benefits of version control or be mad at it for bringing back this monstrosity to life again and again...

Now if you will excuse me I need to grab some holy water from the nearby church, the cooldown on my [Turn Undead] spell will clear in a few minutes and I will banish this undead monstrosity from the face of this planet for a couple of hours.... maybe....

Smite this code OH MIGHTY SMITERR!!!

ps. on a serious note I will keep working on this, will update later(yeah yeah, if I had a cent for every unfulfilled "will update later" comment that I have seen I would easily acquired the necessary funds to go to Mars with Elon Musk :( )
