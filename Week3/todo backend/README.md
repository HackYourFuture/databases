This is ment for a live Q&A exercise about making a backend for a todo app, with a focus on the native mongodb client.

On [todomvc.com](http://todomvc.com/) you can see an example todo app,
and this site has an awesome overview of different implementations of the same todo app.

The `secrets.json.example` should be copied to `secrets.json`. 
It's good to mention this practice, to keep passwords out of version control. 

There is `postman-collection.json` file that you can import to easily demonstrate all the endpoints.

The content of this exercise is based on [a tutorial on Zellwk.com](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/)
The `server.js` should be started using `npm run dev` that will use nodemon to hot-reload the server.
There are four CRUD endpoints listed already that can be implemented live.
