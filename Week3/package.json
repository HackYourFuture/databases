  "description": "In the final week, additional theory will be covered to discuss more complex relational data. Students will learn about entity relationship modelling and how to convert these models to a database schema using normalisation and foreign-key constraints. Non-relational data will also be considered, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of relational and non-relational models.",
