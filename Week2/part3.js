//I want to develop a ToDo app in which a user can create a multiple ToDo lists with different purposes. Each list has at least one item. Each item can be tagged. Each item can be marked completed. There could be reminders for some items.

//Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram for the database of the ToDo App.
