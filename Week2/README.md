# Reading Material Databases Week 2

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 2:

1. [Identifiers (Primary key, Foreign key, Composite key)](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/identifiers)
2. [Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/relationships)
3. [Advanced SQL commands](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/advanced-sql)
   - Joins
   - Aggregate functions
   - Distinct
   - Group By
   - Have
4. [Indexes](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/indexes)
5. [Domain modeling](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/domain-modeling)

## Week goals

This week we are going to start diving deeper into SQL and how to structure your tables. Let's start by looking into identifiers that allow you to add constraints to your database [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/identifiers). After that, let's look into relationships between tables. There are three types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many), read about when to use them over [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/relationships).

Next we will look at more complex SQL commands that will be needed now that the table structures are getting more complicated. Let's look into the advanced sql commands and when to use them [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/advanced-sql).

With more complex and bigger databases performance can become a problem. To help you solve this, you can configure your database in such a way to speed up specific queries using [Indexes](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/indexes). Finally, with all of these relationships between multiple tables it can become a little hard to keep track. To help visualise your databases we generally use what is called an Entity Relationship Diagram, read all about them [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/domain-modeling).

Bonus: We have a bonus video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIuyUum3XU) of one of our mentors (@Unmesh on slack! Thank him if you found it useful) going through a practical example of how to deal with the asynchronicity of working with databases.

Bonus 2: A second bonus video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08wAwrWEec) that goes through some of the topics of this week: keys, relationships and joins. Again it is @Unmesh on slack, a thanks if this helped you is much appreciated!
