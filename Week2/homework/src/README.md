To make the app work properly, the steps have to be followed:

1 - Create a data base calles 'new_world'
2 - Use the world.sql file in Week2 folder as source
3 - Run the sql code in part1.4_storedProcedure.sql file in Week2/homework/src
4 - Run the sql code in part2_alert.sql file in Week2/homework/src
5 - You can now run the app by typing 'node part2_alert.js' and choose queries.

Have fun! :)
