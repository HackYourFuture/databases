To make the app work properly, the steps have to be followed:

1 - Create a data base called 'new_world'.
2 - Use the world.sql file in Week2 folder as source.
3 - Run the sql code in Week2/homework/src/part1.4_storedProcedure.sql file in MySQL prompt.
4 - Run the sql code in Week2/homework/src/part2_alert.sql file in MySQL prompt.
5 - You can now run the app by typing 'node part1_app.js' and choose queries.

Have fun! :)
